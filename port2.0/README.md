PORTFOLIO2.0

## SRC

In the src folder we have an additional folder for the components, then we have a couple files; app.css, app.js. app.test.js, index.css, index.js, logo.svg, reportWebVitals.js, and setupTest.js. 
The only files that I've used were the app.css and the app.js
in the app.css thats where I styled the landing page which still needs more work.
in the app.js i had to do all my imports like import React from 'react', importing the Navabr and the Footer.
Then I had to make the App a function and to return the components of the landingpage. So the app would return the NavBar, a section that was needed, and a footer. I'm still working on how to get the footer to stay on the bottom.

## COMPONENTS

In the components folder you will have the aboutMe folder, contact, footer, and Navbar. 
the aboutme and the contact sections are still undercontruction. 
the the Footer folder, there is a Footer.css and a Footer.js file. in the Footer.css its me trying to move the footer to the bottom of the page instead of in the middle. In the footer.js I had to import react from 'react' and import the footer.css. Then the footer will return the default footer, inside the footer there are three diiferent lists; there will be a link to the linked in account, the github account, and a way to contact me. Moving on to the Navbar
The Navbar is still under construction but you so have the Navbar.css, menuItem.js and Navbar.js. I also put in a buttons.css that I will move back to, but in the navbar.js I had to import the react component from react, import menuItems and the Navbar.css.
In the navbar.js there is a ul that contains a map for menuItems. so the key index will get the item, the items className, the items url, and the item title.
on the MenuItems.js there is an about me section that is under constuction, portfolio which takes you to my portfolio, contact which is still under constrcution, and resume that takes you to my resume via google docs.
the Navbar.css is the colors used, and the nav menu as well as the font family.

## PACKAGES NEEDED

In order to get this up and running I had to make sure i created a react app by npx create react app. then I had to make sure the importing of react aligned with the localhost. finally trying to add bootstrap.
